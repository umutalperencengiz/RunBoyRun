1-) to play game make sure all files in one folder 
and run python not code . 
In visual studio code select folder which our games  in then select main.py, after select run python.
In other developing tools make same.
If there is an error I did make exe file of game : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1brJ-3lKtdeLS_Sufrz1k1Ysxbr_aminh/view?usp=share_link
it is above to 1 gb
2-) Gameplay
  w or up key for go up 
  s or down key for go down
  d or right key for go right
  a or left key for go left
  space key to throw magical fire to kill enemies on us if you hit from helmet the enemies they don't die
Hints:
	1-)the enemies will be spawn nearly middle of the screen to end of the screen
	2-)When you kill enemy you will gain 20 score points.
	3-)When 1 second spent in game , you gain 10 score points.
	4-)When you die you can restart from zero.
	5-)There are breakpoints when you pass 1000 you will see more enemy on the screen as well as above 2000.
